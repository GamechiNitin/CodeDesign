# Iterator Pattern
* In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design patternin which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the containerâ€™s elements.
* The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers in some cases,algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
